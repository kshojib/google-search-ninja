## Introduction

Google Search is a powerful tool that can help you find almost anything on the internet. However, not everyone knows how to use it to its full potential. This repository is designed to help you become a "Google Search Ninja" by teaching you advanced search techniques that can save you time and frustration.


### Trick 1: Use specific keywords

When searching for technical documentation or specific code examples, using specific and relevant keywords is crucial for getting accurate search results.

Example: To find information on a specific JavaScript method, search for the method name along with any relevant keywords, such as "JavaScript array map function" instead of just "JavaScript array function".

### Trick 2: Use quotation marks

When searching for exact code snippets or error messages, using quotation marks can help ensure that Google searches for the exact phrase you need.

Example: To search for a specific error message you encountered in your code, search for the exact message in quotation marks, such as "TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined".

### Trick 3: Use the minus sign

When searching for programming tutorials or examples, sometimes you may need to exclude certain keywords to get the results you need.

Example: To search for tutorials on React hooks but exclude results that mention Redux, search for "React hooks -Redux" to get more relevant results.


### Trick 4: Use the site: operator

Use the site: operator followed by the website's URL to search for information on a specific website.

Example: To search for information about Python on the official Python website, search for "Python site:python.org" to get results only from that website.

### Trick 5: Use the intitle: operator

Use the intitle: operator followed by your search terms to search for a specific word or phrase in the title of a webpage.

Example: To search for information about Python exception handling, search for "intitle:Python exception handling" to get results that have those keywords in the title of the webpage.

### Trick 6: Use the filetype: operator

Use the filetype: operator followed by the file extension to search for a specific type of file (e.g. PDF, Word document).

Example: To search for a PDF guide on how to use Git, search for "Git filetype:pdf" to get results that are only in PDF format.

### Trick 7: Use the related: operator

Use the related: operator followed by the website's URL to search for websites that are similar to a specific website.

Example: To search for websites that are similar to Stack Overflow, search for "related:stackoverflow.com" to get a list of websites that are similar in content and function to Stack Overflow.
